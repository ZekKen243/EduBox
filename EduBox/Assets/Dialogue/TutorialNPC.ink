Hi there! Welcome to EduBox!
My name's Blocky, and I'm here to introduce you to the game!
You're currently in the tutorial level, have a look around and get a feel for your controls. 
You can probably already guess that you can move around with the WASD keys, you can also rotate the camera by holding right click and dragging around.
Now, next to me is a strange green looking slate, this is where you should start as it teaches you a bitesize lesson of a topic. Learn well from it as you will need the knowledge to solve the red slates around.
Completing red slates in the world will unlock new things in the environment, or the door to the next level!
Now go on! Have a try!~
